# Bug Fix! a platformer game. V-1.0


This is a platformer game with a cave theme and music. its version 1.0 so dont expect anything incredible, the code and assets can be used by anyone for any purpose(just dont pass it off as your own) this is the first game I've ever made.
all music for the game was created using bosca ceoil, and audacity. 

Here are instructions on how to edit and customize the game:

Line 26: This line defines what the pygame windows is titled.

Lines 28 to 31: These lines control the audio that plays during the game, to change the game music just change where it says "final_game_music.wav" to whatever the name of your new song is. (Make sure the audio is always placed in the "Bug Fix! Code" folder, otherwise it wont work.

Lines 33 to 44: These lines set up the credits that roll at the beginning of the game, you can delete them if you dont want any credits.

Line 48: This line controls the background of the game, i used pixelartmaker.com to make all of the graphics for the game.

After this we get into the more complicated code of the game, there isn't much to customize in here thought you're welcome to try. 

Line 67 and line 69: These lines control which keys control the game, if you want to use arrow keys then change them to "K_LEFT" and "K_RIGHT"

Line 87: This line controls how high you jump, dont make it too high or the game freezes when you jump.
